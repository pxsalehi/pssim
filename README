Compile with JDK 1.6 or compliance level 1.6

Execution seems to work with JDK 1.7 or lower only. Compiling with level 1.6 and running with 1.8 gives LVTT errors.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
- If you receive the exception LVTT entry not found, the class that causes the exception while being
  rewritten, needs to be compiled with -g:lines,source. The option -g:vars MUST not be included, as 
  it will produce the same exception. In Eclipse: Uncheck option "Add variable attributes to generated 
  class files (used by the debugger )". Leave options "Add line number attributes to generated class 
  files (used by the debugger )" and "Add source file name to generated class files 
  (used by the debugger )" checked.
  
- Updated BCEL to 5.2, used by JiST:
  You will get two compilation errors in classes jist.runtime.RemoteJist.RemoteRepository and 
  jist.runtime.RewriterVerify. Just let Eclipse fix them automatically. 
  Implement default jist.runtime.RemoteJist.RemoteRepository.getClassPath() method that returns null.
  Define jist.runtime.RewriterVerify.checkme() to throw ClassNotFoundException or put the call to 
  org.apache.bcel.Repository.lookupClass(name) inside try ... catch.
